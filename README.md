TemplateMod
======================

To build new jar:
`mvn install`

To load the jar on a Spiggot Minecraft server copy it to the `plugins` directory and issue a `reload` command on the server.

This template Mod has a single command available out of the box, which you should be able to use as a server admin to log a message to the server log.
